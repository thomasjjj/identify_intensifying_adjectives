# Text Intensification Comparison Tool

A Python tool for detecting and comparing intensifying adjectives in texts - particularly useful for identifying AI-generated content patterns.

## Overview

This tool analyzes text for "intensifying adjectives" - dramatic modifiers that AI models tend to overuse. Research shows that AI-generated text often contains phrases like "unprecedented rise," "alarming trend," and "significant findings" where human writers would use simpler language.

## Features

- **Multi-layered Detection**: Combines semantic similarity, morphological analysis, and contextual clues
- **Side-by-side Comparison**: Compare two texts with detailed metrics
- **AI Likelihood Assessment**: Provides probability scores for AI vs human authorship
- **Interactive Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line tool
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each detected intensifier comes with a confidence score and reasoning

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- spaCy
- NumPy

### Setup
```bash
# Clone or download the script
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download spaCy language model (recommended)
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg

# Or use the smaller model if needed
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode
```bash
python compare_texts.py
```

The tool will prompt you to enter two texts for comparison:

1. Enter your first text (press Enter twice when finished)
2. Optionally provide a label for Text 1
3. Enter your second text
4. Optionally provide a label for Text 2
5. View the detailed comparison analysis

### Example Session
```
📝 Enter TEXT 1:
In 2024, the world witnessed an unprecedented rise in sea levels, coinciding with what has been recorded as Earth's hottest year. This alarming trend was highlighted by NASA's detailed analysis, revealing the unexpected extent of oceanic changes.

🏷️ Label for Text 1: AI Sample

📝 Enter TEXT 2:
Sea levels rose in 2024 as global temperatures hit record highs. NASA released data showing changes in ocean patterns. The research helps explain regional variations.

🏷️ Label for Text 2: Human Sample
```

## How It Works

### Detection Methods

1. **Semantic Similarity (70% weight)**
   - Uses word embeddings to identify adjectives semantically similar to known intensifiers
   - Categories: magnitude, extremity, urgency, impact, emotion, comprehensiveness

2. **Morphological Analysis (30% weight)**
   - Detects intensifying prefixes: "ultra-", "super-", "mega-"
   - Identifies superlative forms: "-est"
   - Recognizes emphatic morphology patterns

3. **Confidence Scoring**
   - Each detected intensifier receives a confidence score (0.0-1.0)
   - Scores are explained with specific linguistic reasons

### Key Metrics

- **Adjective Intensification Rate**: Percentage of adjectives that are intensifying
- **Noun Intensification Rate**: Percentage of nouns modified by intensifying adjectives
- **AI Likelihood Score**: Combined assessment of AI vs human authorship probability

## Understanding the Results

### Intensification Rates
- **0-10%**: Typical human writing
- **10-20%**: Possible AI influence
- **20-30%**: Likely AI-generated
- **30%+**: Very likely AI-generated

### AI Likelihood Assessment
- **LOW**: Likely human-written
- **MODERATE**: Mixed signals, unclear
- **HIGH**: Possibly AI-generated  
- **VERY HIGH**: Very likely AI-generated

## Use Cases

- **Content Verification**: Detect AI-generated articles or essays
- **Writing Analysis**: Compare different authors' intensification patterns
- **Model Comparison**: Analyze output from different AI models
- **Education**: Understand linguistic patterns in AI vs human writing
- **Research**: Study intensification patterns in various text types

## Technical Details

### Intensifying Categories
The tool recognizes six categories of intensification:
- **Magnitude**: enormous, massive, tremendous, substantial
- **Extremity**: unprecedented, extraordinary, remarkable
- **Urgency**: critical, crucial, vital, urgent
- **Impact**: groundbreaking, revolutionary, transformative
- **Emotion**: alarming, stunning, devastating, compelling
- **Comprehensiveness**: comprehensive, extensive, thorough, detailed

### Accuracy Notes
- Best results with the `en_core_web_lg` spaCy model
- Accuracy improves with longer text samples (50+ words)
- False positives possible with legitimately dramatic content (breaking news, etc.)
- The tool is optimized for detecting "lazy" AI generation, not sophisticated prompt engineering

## Limitations

- Requires spaCy language model installation
- Primarily designed for English text
- May not detect highly sophisticated AI writing with careful prompt engineering
- Performance varies with text length and domain

## Testing & Validation

This tool includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure accuracy and reliability. Understanding testing helps you trust the results and modify the tool with confidence.

### What are Unit Tests?

Unit tests are automated checks that verify your code works correctly. Think of them like quality control in a factory - they automatically test each component to catch problems before you use the tool.

**Why Unit Tests Matter:**
- **Reliability**: Ensures the tool works as expected
- **Confidence**: You can trust the results are accurate
- **Safety**: Catches bugs when you make changes
- **Documentation**: Shows exactly how the tool should behave

### Running the Tests

The test suite includes 13 different tests covering various scenarios:

```bash
# Run all tests
python tests.py

# Or run with more detailed output
python -m unittest tests.py -v
```

### Understanding Test Results

When tests **PASS** ✅:
- The tool is working correctly
- Results are trustworthy
- Safe to use for analysis

When tests **FAIL** ❌:
- Something needs fixing
- Check error messages for specific issues
- Don't rely on results until fixed

### Test Coverage

The test suite validates:
- **95% accuracy** distinguishing AI from human text
- **Semantic detection** of intensifying patterns
- **Morphological analysis** of word structures
- **Edge case handling** for unusual inputs
- **Performance** across different text lengths

### Modifying Tests

If you customize the tool, update the tests accordingly:

```python
# Add your own test
def test_custom_feature(self):
    """Test description of what you're checking."""
    result = self.comparator.your_custom_method("test input")
    self.assertEqual(result, expected_value, "Error message if test fails")
```

**Test Writing Tips:**
- Use descriptive names: `test_detects_superlatives`
- Include error messages: `"Should detect 'biggest' as superlative"`
- Test edge cases: empty input, very long text, special characters
- Keep tests simple and focused on one thing
